Hogget. A function standard library for Swift.

## Motivation

Finally with Swift, Cocoa developers have access to a language with parametric polymorphism, ADTs, and tuples.

Hogget implements 

## Contributing

There are a few style guides.

1. Functions in Hogget take arguments in SVO order. e.g. map() is map(List, Function), not map(Function, List). This is ordering is required by Swift for call-lambda syntax to work.

2. Hogget is split into *libraries*, such as the Array library. Each function occupies its own *file*, which contains: a) implementation, b) documentation, c) testing, d) benchmarking. The functions in each library are assembled into one swift file by `gen.py` which is run on a pre-commit hook.
